# Enhanced Constraint-Based Generator (ECTG)


This repository contains the implementation and experimental data for the **ECTG** approach proposed in our paper:


> **A Enhanced Constraint-Based Generator for Automated Combinatorial Testing Flow**  

ECTG supports three types of coverage criteria: standard covering array (CA) requirements, tester-specified combinations, and a hybrid of both. It also offers two types of test oracles:

* One maps inputs to expected outputs based on predefined rules (result rules);
* The other leverages metamorphic relations to define output relationships for related inputs.


These features make it more practical for real-world testing scenarios.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

### `/generator`
Contains the three generators: ACTS, PICT, and ECTG, along with usage instructions.



### `/models`
Includes the input parameter model files for ACTS and PICT.
For ECTG, please refer to its dedicated usage instructions.



### `/results`
Provides the test cases generated by ACTS, PICT, and ECTG.
The file `coverage.xlsx` in this folder summarizes how the 12 entities are covered by each test set.
